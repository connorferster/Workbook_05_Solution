    "> ### Why are we returning _two_ values?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look back to **Task 04/D**, when we created a pin support, we had to do a few things:\n",
    "1. Add our reaction `Symbol` (e.g. `RP_1` or whatever) to a list of reaction symbols\n",
    "2. Add our reactions as \"loads\" to the `Beam` object\n",
    "3. Add our boundary conditions at the support location (within the `Beam` object)\n",
    "\n",
    "Items **2** and **3** are changes made to the `Beam` object and when we return the altered `Beam` object at the end of our function it will have the changed data within it. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we _solve_ the beam object with `.solve_for_reaction_loads()` we have to pass all of our reaction symbols to the method in order for them to be solved. This means, after our function runs, we need to have access to the reaction symbol that was created _within_ the function. Remember, using `return` is the way that we can transfer data from inside the function scope to outside the function scope. By returning the symbol created within the function along with the `Beam`, we can add the symbol to an accumulator in our \"master loop\".\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_: The fact that we need to externally pass the reaction symbols to the `Beam` object is, to me, a design flaw of the sympy `beam` module. I plan on submitting a change to the beam module in the future so that this does not need to happen but, for now, this is the way it has to work. "

    "This was a big assignment. Hopefully it went a little faster because you were able to copy-paste and generally re-use code you have written before.\n",

    "The process of writing functions and \"helper\" functions is part of what's called \"functional program design\". You write functions that perform all of the individual small tasks you need to do. From there, you combine them to perform the larger tasks. Eventually, you may end up with a program that just calls one or two functions to do all of the work by calling all of your smaller functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is one very good way of designing programs. Done properly (using one-task-per-function and writing tests for each function) you can build powerful and robust programs very quickly.\n",
